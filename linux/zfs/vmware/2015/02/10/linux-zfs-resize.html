    <h2>Linux ZFS & resizing single disk pool</h2>
    <p>10 Feb 2015 - </p>
</div>

<div class="post-content">
<p>In a virutal enviorment I have found that I still like a lot of the features of zfs, but I do not end the RAID functionaily.  With that I had the need to expand a single disk zpool due to space issues.  In the past, we simply just added a second disk creating a RAID 0.  But I knew there was a better way.  ZFS on Linux does support resizing or autoexpand on a single disk zpool.  To do this, do the following steps.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Create or Set your zpool with autoextend on (it defaults to off)</p>

    <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code> zpool set autoexpand=on tank
</code></pre></div>    </div>
  </li>
  <li>Via your Virtual Host tools, extend the disk in question to the size you need.</li>
  <li>
    <p>Now on your VM, get the disk name in your zpool</p>

    <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code> zpool status
</code></pre></div>    </div>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Run parted on that disk to resize the partition.</p>

    <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code> parted /dev/sdb
</code></pre></div>    </div>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Now simply use resizepart and it will default to the max</p>

    <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code> (parted) resizepart                                                       
 Partition number? 1                                                       
 End?  [X.XGB]?                                                           
 (parted) quit   
</code></pre></div>    </div>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Now that you completed that, you need to just tell the zpool to expand.  You can do this online by running the following command.</p>

    <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code> zpool online -e tank sdb
</code></pre></div>    </div>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You should now notice that your partition is now larger</p>

    <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code> df -h
</code></pre></div>    </div>
  </li>
</ol>
